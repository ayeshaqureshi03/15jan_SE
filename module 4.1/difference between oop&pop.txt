Different between oop & pop:-

*oop:-
->oop is object oriented programming.
->the program is divided into objects.
->Bottom-up approach.
->Data can be hidden using encapsulation.
->overloading function is possible.
->the existing code can be reused.
->examples:-c,pascal,fortran.

*pop:-
->pop is procedure oriented programming.
->the program is divided into function.
->Top-down approach.
->No data hiding data is accesible globally.
->overloading is not possible.
->no code reusability.
->examples:-c++,java,python.
